## Pencil McGee

Pencil McGee is an innovative 2D platforming game that lets players use their creativity to solve challenging levels. Unlike traditional platformers, Pencil McGee allows players to "write" their own platforms, making it a truly unique gaming experience.

In Pencil McGee, players take on the role of the titular character, a young artist armed with a magic pencil. With this pencil, players can create platforms of various shapes and sizes, which they can use to traverse through each level. Whether it's drawing a bridge over a gap, creating steps to reach a high platform, or blocking an enemy's path, the possibilities are endless.

The game's hand-drawn graphics and vibrant color scheme create a charming and inviting world for players to explore. Each level presents a new challenge, with obstacles ranging from moving platforms to spikes and enemy creatures. But with Pencil McGee's magic pencil, players can always find a creative solution.
